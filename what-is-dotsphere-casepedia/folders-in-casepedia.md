# Folders in Casepedia

In Casepedia, a folder is a location where you can store and organize documents.

In the Folder UI, you can:

* Create folders and sub folders
* Add documents to folders and sub folders.
* Assign permission at folder level, sub folder level and also at file level. The users can perform operations on a folder, sub folder or a file based on the permissions assigned.
* View document and document metadata
* Add versions to documents and delete a document version
* Update document metadata information
* Check-in and check-out documents

Folders are of two types:

* Root Folder which is a master folder created by default with the Casepedia deployment.
* Folders and Sub folders that can be created within the Root folder by authorized users.
